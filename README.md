## What’s Inside

- **StarterCode/initialize_coffee_db.sql**  
  Code to create and populate a fake coffee shop database with realistic sample data.  
  Follow along the given tutorial to run this file in MySQL Workbench to set up your practice environment.

- **AssignmentFiles/SQL_basics.sql**  
  Practice file covering **SQL basics** such as `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and simple filtering.  
  Complete this assignment first, right after the tutorial.

- **AssignmentFiles/SQL_filtering_agg.sql**  
  Practice file covering **filtering and aggregation**: `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, and more.  
  You’ll return to this file after finishing the Filtering & Aggregation lesson.

- **AssignmentFiles/SQL_joins.sql**  
  Practice file covering **joins and relationships**: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, subqueries, and multi-table queries.  
  You’ll complete this after the SQL Joins lesson.



## Workflow

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.  
2. Clone it locally so you can edit the `.sql` files on your machine.  
3. Open MySQL Workbench and run `StarterCode/initialize_coffee_db.sql` to create the database.  
4. Complete the assignments in order:  
   - Start with **SQL_basics.sql**  
   - Return after each lesson for **SQL_filtering_agg.sql** and **SQL_joins.sql**  
5. As you answer the questions, save your work in the same `.sql` files.  
6. Commit and push your changes regularly to keep your repository updated.



## Submitting Your Work

- At the end of the **SQL Joins** lesson, submit the **link to your GitHub repository** in the space provided in OpenClass.
- Make sure all three assignment files show your completed queries.  
- This assignment submission takes the place of your weekly quiz.  



## Notes

- Comment your queries in the `.sql` files so it’s clear which question you’re answering.  
  Example:  
  ```sql 
  -- Q1) List all customers from Līhuʻe  
  SELECT * FROM customers WHERE city = 'Līhuʻe';  
  ```

- Don’t worry if your queries evolve over time — commit history shows your progress.  
- If you get stuck, revisit the examples in class or ask for help in Slack.
